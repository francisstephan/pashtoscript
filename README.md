# pashtoscript

An easy way to use your latin keyboard to type in pashto script.

See for instance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashto#Writing_system

Developed with Scalajs and scalajs-react

## Usage

Refer to the tables of correspondence to type the desired chars.

After a time this will become quite natural, and you will no longer need to refer to the tables.
